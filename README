This project contains some example/test code related to implementing monads in
C.  This is all about just playing around with ideas for how to better control
state in C, and isn't intended to be production code.  Memory leaks, unhandled
corner cases, and undefined behavior likely abound.

For the sake of sanity, GCC extensions are used. The code isn't likely to
build with any other compilers without refactoring.
